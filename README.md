# To-do list app made in rust

### Basically so I can customize my to-do list app

#### Ideas

- sorting & priority sytem based on
  - which assignments will most easily raise an okay grade
  - which assignments will most effectively raise the lowest grade (independent of how high the grade will be raised)
- grade criteria field (grade letter to percentage ratio)
- user-defined priority
- integrate todoist API so I can easily move all my lists over 

#### To-Do

- [x] figure out rust structs and making instances of them
- [ ] make the functions for interfacing and indexing with objects
- [ ] make function to index objects prettily
- [ ] track assignment priority
- [ ] track class priority
- [ ] UI stuff
- [ ] finish this to-do section (maybe make this list in the app as an example)
